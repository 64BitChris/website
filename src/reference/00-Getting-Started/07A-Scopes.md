Scopes
------

This page describes scopes. It assumes you've read and understood the
previous pages, [build definition][Basic-Def] and [task graph][Task-Graph].

### The whole story about keys

[Previously][Basic-Def] we pretended that a key like `name` corresponded
to one entry in sbt's map of key-value pairs. This was a simplification.

In truth, each key can have an associated value in more than one
context, called a *scope.*

Some concrete examples:

- if you have multiple projects (also called subprojects) in your build definition, a key can
  have a different value in each project.
- the `compile` key may have a different value for your main sources and
  your test sources, if you want to compile them differently.
- the `packageOptions` key (which contains options for creating jar
  packages) may have different values when packaging class files
  (`packageBin`) or packaging source code (`packageSrc`).

*There is no single value for a given key `name`*, because the value may
differ according to scope.

However, there is a single value for a given *scoped* key.

If you think about sbt processing a list of settings to generate a
key-value map describing the project, as
[discussed earlier][Basic-Def], the keys in that key-value map are
*scoped* keys. Each setting defined in the build definition (for example
in `build.sbt`) applies to a scoped key as well.

Often the scope is implied or has a default, but if the defaults are
wrong, you'll need to mention the desired scope in `build.sbt`.

### Scope axes

A *scope axis* is a type constructor similar to `Option[A]`,
that is used to form a component in a scope.

There are three scope axes:

- The subproject axis
- The dependency configuration axis
- The task axis

If you're not familiar with the notion of *axis*, we can think of the RGB color cube
as an example:

![color cube](files/rgb_color_solid_cube.png)

In the RGB color model, all colors are represented by a point in the cube whose axes
correspond to red, green, and blue components encoded by a number.
Similarly, a full scope in sbt is formed by a **tuple** of a subproject,
a configuration, and a task value:

```scala
scalacOptions in (projA, Compile, console)
```

To be more precise, it actually looks like this:

```scala
scalacOptions in (Select(projA: Reference),
                  Select(Compile: ConfigKey),
                  Select(console.key))
```

#### Scoping by the subproject axis

If you [put multiple projects in a single build][Multi-Project], each
project needs its own settings. That is, keys can be scoped according to
the project.

The project axis can also be set to `ThisBuild`, which means the "entire build",
so a setting applies to the entire build rather than a single project.
Build-level settings are often used as a fallback when a project doesn't define a
project-specific setting. We will discuss more on build-level settings later in this page.

#### Scoping by the configuration axis

A *dependency configuration* (or "configuration" for short) defines
a graph of library dependencies, potentially with its own
classpath, sources, generated packages, etc. The dependency configuration concept
comes from Ivy, which sbt uses for
managed dependencies [Library Dependencies][Library-Dependencies], and from
[MavenScopes](https://maven.apache.org/guides/introduction/introduction-to-dependency-mechanism.html#Dependency_Scope).

Some configurations you'll see in sbt:

- `Compile` which defines the main build (`src/main/scala`).
- `Test` which defines how to build tests (`src/test/scala`).
- `Runtime` which defines the classpath for the `run` task.

By default, all the keys associated with compiling, packaging, and
running are scoped to a configuration and therefore may work differently
in each configuration. The most obvious examples are the task keys
`compile`, `package`, and `run`; but all the keys which *affect* those keys
(such as `sourceDirectories` or `scalacOptions` or `fullClasspath`) are also
scoped to the configuration.

Another thing to note about a configuration is that it can extend other configurations.
The following figure shows the extension relationship among the most common configurations.

![dependency configurations](files/sbt-configurations.png)

`Test` and `IntegrationTest` extends `Runtime`; `Runtime` extends `Compile`;
`CompileInternal` extends `Compile`, `Optional`, and `Provided`.

#### Scoping by Task axis

Settings can affect how a task works. For example, the `packageSrc` task
is affected by the `packageOptions` setting.

To support this, a task key (such as `packageSrc`) can be a scope for
another key (such as `packageOptions`).

The various tasks that build a package (`packageSrc`, `packageBin`,
`packageDoc`) can share keys related to packaging, such as `artifactName`
and `packageOptions`. Those keys can have distinct values for each
packaging task.

#### Global scope component

Each scope axis can be filled in with an instance of the axis type (for
example the task axis can be filled in with a task), or the axis can be
filled in with the special value `Global`, which is also written as `*`. So we can think of `Global` as `None`.

`*` is a universal fallback for all scope axes,
but its direct use should be reserved to sbt and plugin authors in most cases.

To make the matter confusing, `someKey in Global` appearing in build definition implicitly converts to `someKey in (Global, Global, Global)`.

### Referring to scopes in a build definition

If you create a setting in `build.sbt` with a bare key, it will be scoped
to (current subproject, configuration `Global`, task `Global`):

```scala
lazy val root = (project in file("."))
  .settings(
    name := "hello"
  )
```

Run sbt and `inspect name` to see that it's provided by
`{file:/home/hp/checkout/hello/}default-aea33a/*:name`, that is, the
project is `{file:/home/hp/checkout/hello/}default-aea33a`, the
configuration is `*` (means `Global`), and the task is not shown (which
also means `Global`).

A bare key on the right hand side is also scoped to
(current subproject, configuration `Global`, task `Global`):

```
organization := name.value
```

Keys have an overloaded method called `.in` that is used to set the scope.
The argument to `.in(...)` can be an instance of any of the scope axes. So for
example, though there's no real reason to do this, you could set the
`name` scoped to the `Compile` configuration:

```scala
name in Compile := "hello"
```

or you could set the name scoped to the `packageBin` task (pointless! just
an example):

```scala
name in packageBin := "hello"
```

or you could set the `name` with multiple scope axes, for example in the
`packageBin` task in the `Compile` configuration:

```scala
name in (Compile, packageBin) := "hello"
```

or you could use `Global` for all axes:

```scala
// same as concurrentRestrictions in (Global, Global, Global)
concurrentRestrictions in Global := Seq(
  Tags.limitAll(1)
)
```

(`concurrentRestrictions in Global` implicitly converts to
`concurrentRestrictions in (Global, Global, Global)`, setting
all axes to `Global` scope component; the task and configuration are already
`Global` by default, so here the effect is to make the project `Global`,
that is, define `*/*:concurrentRestrictions` rather than
`{file:/home/hp/checkout/hello/}default-aea33a/*:concurrentRestrictions`)

### Referring to scoped keys from the sbt shell

On the command line and in the sbt shell, sbt displays (and parses)
scoped keys like this:

```
{<build-uri>}<project-id>/config:intask::key
```

- `{<build-uri>}<project-id>` identifies the subproject axis. The
  `<project-id>` part will be missing if the subproject axis has "entire build" scope.
- `config` identifies the configuration axis.
- `intask` identifies the task axis.
- `key` identifies the key being scoped.

`*` can appear for each axis, referring to the `Global` scope.

If you omit part of the scoped key, it will be inferred as follows:

- the current project will be used if you omit the project.
- a key-dependent configuration will be auto-detected if you omit the
  configuration or task.

For more details, see [Interacting with the Configuration System][Inspecting-Settings].

### Examples of scoped key notation

- `fullClasspath` specifies just a key, so the default scopes are used:
  current project, a key-dependent configuration, and global task
  scope.
- `test:fullClasspath` specifies the configuration, so this is
  `fullClasspath` in the `test` configuration, with defaults for the other
  two scope axes.
- `*:fullClasspath` specifies `Global` for the configuration, rather than
  the default configuration.
- `doc::fullClasspath` specifies the `fullClasspath` key scoped to the `doc`
  task, with the defaults for the project and configuration axes.
- `{file:/home/hp/checkout/hello/}default-aea33a/test:fullClasspath`
  specifies a project, `{file:/home/hp/checkout/hello/}default-aea33a`,
  where the project is identified with the build
  `{file:/home/hp/checkout/hello/}` and then a project id inside that
  build `default-aea33a`. Also specifies configuration `test`, but leaves
  the default task axis.
- `{file:/home/hp/checkout/hello/}/test:fullClasspath` sets the project
  axis to "entire build" where the build is
  `{file:/home/hp/checkout/hello/}`.
- `{.}/test:fullClasspath` sets the project axis to "entire build" where
  the build is `{.}`. `{.}` can be written `ThisBuild` in Scala code.
- `{file:/home/hp/checkout/hello/}/compile:doc::fullClasspath` sets all
  three scope axes.

### Inspecting scopes

In sbt shell, you can use the `inspect` command to understand
keys and their scopes. Try `inspect test:fullClasspath`:

```
\$ sbt
> inspect test:fullClasspath
[info] Task: scala.collection.Seq[sbt.Attributed[java.io.File]]
[info] Description:
[info]  The exported classpath, consisting of build products and unmanaged and managed, internal and external dependencies.
[info] Provided by:
[info]  {file:/home/hp/checkout/hello/}default-aea33a/test:fullClasspath
[info] Dependencies:
[info]  test:exportedProducts
[info]  test:dependencyClasspath
[info] Reverse dependencies:
[info]  test:runMain
[info]  test:run
[info]  test:testLoader
[info]  test:console
[info] Delegates:
[info]  test:fullClasspath
[info]  runtime:fullClasspath
[info]  compile:fullClasspath
[info]  *:fullClasspath
[info]  {.}/test:fullClasspath
[info]  {.}/runtime:fullClasspath
[info]  {.}/compile:fullClasspath
[info]  {.}/*:fullClasspath
[info]  */test:fullClasspath
[info]  */runtime:fullClasspath
[info]  */compile:fullClasspath
[info]  */*:fullClasspath
[info] Related:
[info]  compile:fullClasspath
[info]  compile:fullClasspath(for doc)
[info]  test:fullClasspath(for doc)
[info]  runtime:fullClasspath
```

On the first line, you can see this is a task (as opposed to a setting,
as explained in [.sbt build definition][Basic-Def]). The value
resulting from the task will have type
`scala.collection.Seq[sbt.Attributed[java.io.File]]`.

"Provided by" points you to the scoped key that defines the value, in
this case
`{file:/home/hp/checkout/hello/}default-aea33a/test:fullClasspath` (which
is the `fullClasspath` key scoped to the `test` configuration and the
`{file:/home/hp/checkout/hello/}default-aea33a` project).

"Dependencies" was discussed in detail in the [previous page][Task-Graph].

We'll discuss "Delegates" later.

Try `inspect fullClasspath` (as opposed to the above example,
inspect `test:fullClasspath`) to get a sense of the difference. Because
the configuration is omitted, it is autodetected as `compile`.
`inspect compile:fullClasspath` should therefore look the same as
`inspect fullClasspath`.

Try `inspect *:fullClasspath` for another contrast. `fullClasspath` is not
defined in the `Global` scope by default.

Again, for more details, see [Interacting with the Configuration System][Inspecting-Settings].

### When to specify a scope

You need to specify the scope if the key in question is normally scoped.
For example, the `compile` task, by default, is scoped to `Compile` and `Test`
configurations, and does not exist outside of those scopes.

To change the value associated with the `compile` key, you need to write
`compile in Compile` or `compile in Test`. Using plain `compile` would define
a new compile task scoped to the current project, rather than overriding
the standard compile tasks which are scoped to a configuration.

If you get an error like *"Reference to undefined setting"*, often
you've failed to specify a scope, or you've specified the wrong scope.
The key you're using may be defined in some other scope. sbt will try to
suggest what you meant as part of the error message; look for "Did you
mean compile:compile?"

One way to think of it is that a name is only *part* of a key. In
reality, all keys consist of both a name, and a scope (where the scope
has three axes). The entire expression
`packageOptions in (Compile, packageBin)` is a key name, in other words.
Simply `packageOptions` is also a key name, but a different one (for keys
with no in, a scope is implicitly assumed: current project, global
config, global task).

### Build-level settings

An advanced technique for factoring out common settings
across subprojects is to define the settings scoped to `ThisBuild`.

If a key that is scoped to a particular subproject is not found,
sbt will look for it in `ThisBuild` as a fallback.
Using the mechanism, we can define a build-level default setting for
frequently used keys such as `version`, `scalaVersion`, and `organization`.

For convenience, there is `inThisBuild(...)` function that will
scope both the key and the body of the setting expression to `ThisBuild`.
Putting setting expressions in there would be equivalent to appending `in ThisBuild` where possible.

```scala
lazy val root = (project in file("."))
  .settings(
    inThisBuild(List(
      // Same as:
      // organization in ThisBuild := "com.example"
      organization := "com.example",
      scalaVersion := "$example_scala_version$",
      version      := "0.1.0-SNAPSHOT"
    )),
    name := "Hello",
    publish := (),
    publishLocal := ()
  )

lazy val core = (project in file("core"))
  .settings(
    // other settings
  )

lazy val util = (project in file("util"))
  .settings(
    // other settings
  )
```

Due to the nature of [scope delegation][Scope-Delegation] that we will cover later,
we do not recommend using build-level settings beyond simple value assignments.

### Scope delegation

A scoped key may be undefined, if it has no value associated with it in
its scope.

For each scope axis, sbt has a fallback search path made up of other scope values.
Typically, if a key has no associated value in a more-specific scope,
sbt will try to get a value from a more general scope, such as the `ThisBuild` scope.

This feature allows you to set a value once in a more general scope,
allowing multiple more-specific scopes to inherit the value.
We will discuss [scope delegation][Scope-Delegation] in detail later.
