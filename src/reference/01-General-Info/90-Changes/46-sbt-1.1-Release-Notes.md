### sbt 1.1.1

#### Bug fixes

- Fixes "Modified names for (class) is empty" error. [zinc#292][zinc292] / [zinc#484][zinc484] by [@jvican][@jvican] (Scala Center)
- Fixes tab completion in `console` while running in batch mode as `sbt console`. [#3841][3841]/[#3876][3876] by [@eed3si9n][@eed3si9n]
- Fixes file timestamp retrieval of missing files on Windows. [#3871][3871] / [io#120][io120] by [@cunei][@cunei]
- Aligns the errors thrown by file timestamp implementations. Fixes [#3894][3894] / [io#121][io121] by [@j-keck][@j-keck]
- Adds file timestamps native support for FreeBSD. [#3894][3894] / [io#124][io124] by [@cunei][@cunei]
- Fixes JDK 10 version string parsing. [sbt/sbt-launcher-package#209][launcher209] by [@2m][@2m]

#### Improvements

- Deprecates `Extracted#append` in favour of `appendWithSession` or `appendWithoutSession`.  [#3865][3865] by [@dwijnand][@dwijnand]
- Adds a new global `Boolean` setting called `autoStartServer`. See below.
- Upgrades Scala versions used for sbt cross building `^^`. [#3923][3923] by [@dwijnand][@dwijnand]
- Many documentation maintenance changes by [@xuwei-k][@xuwei-k].

#### autoStartServer setting

sbt 1.1.1 adds a new global `Boolean` setting called `autoStartServer`, which is set to `true` by default.
When set to `true`, sbt shell will automatically start sbt server. Otherwise, it will not start the server until `startSever` command is issued. This could be used to opt out of server for security reasons.

#### Unified slash syntax for sbt shell and build.sbt

This adds unified slash syntax for both sbt shell and the build.sbt DSL.
Instead of the current `<project-id>/config:intask::key`, this adds
`<project-id>/<config-ident>/intask/key` where `<config-ident>` is the Scala identifier
notation for the configurations like `Compile` and `Test`. (The old shell syntax will continue to function)

These examples work both from the shell and in build.sbt.

    Global / cancelable
    ThisBuild / scalaVersion
    Test / test
    root / Compile / compile / scalacOptions
    ProjectRef(uri("file:/xxx/helloworld/"),"root")/Compile/scalacOptions
    Zero / Zero / name

The inspect command now outputs something that can be copy-pasted:

    > inspect compile
    [info] Task: sbt.inc.Analysis
    [info] Description:
    [info]  Compiles sources.
    [info] Provided by:
    [info]  ProjectRef(uri("file:/xxx/helloworld/"),"root")/Compile/compile
    [info] Defined at:
    [info]  (sbt.Defaults) Defaults.scala:326
    [info] Dependencies:
    [info]  Compile/manipulateBytecode
    [info]  Compile/incCompileSetup
    ....

[#1812][1812]/[#3434][3434]/[#3617][3617]/[#3620][3620] by [@eed3si9n][@eed3si9n] and [@dwijnand][@dwijnand]

#### sbt server

sbt server feature was reworked to use Language Server Protocol 3.0 (LSP) as the wire protocol, a protocol created by Microsoft for Visual Studio Code.

To discover a running server, sbt 1.1.0 creates a port file at `./project/target/active.json` relative to a build:

```
{"uri":"local:///Users/foo/.sbt/1.0/server/0845deda85cb41abcdef/sock"}
```

`local:` indicates a UNIX domain socket. Here's how we can say hello to the server using `nc`. (`^M` can be sent `Ctrl-V` then `Return`):

```
\$ nc -U /Users/foo/.sbt/1.0/server/0845deda85cb41abcdef/sock
Content-Length: 99^M
^M
{ "jsonrpc": "2.0", "id": 1, "method": "initialize", "params": { "initializationOptions": { } } }^M
```

sbt server adds network access to sbt's shell command so, in addition to accepting input from the terminal, server also to accepts input from the network. Here's how we can call `compile`:

```
Content-Length: 93^M
^M
{ "jsonrpc": "2.0", "id": 2, "method": "sbt/exec", "params": { "commandLine": "compile" } }^M
```

The running sbt session should now queue `compile`, and return back with compiler warnings and errors, if any:

```
Content-Length: 296
Content-Type: application/vscode-jsonrpc; charset=utf-8

{"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"textDocument/publishDiagnostics","params":{"uri":"file:/Users/foo/work/hellotest/Hello.scala","diagnostics":[{"range":{"start":{"line":2,"character":26},"end":{"line":2,"character":27}},"severity":1,"source":"sbt","message":"object X is not a member of package foo"}]}}
```

[#3524][3524]/[#3556][3556] by [@eed3si9n][@eed3si9n]

#### VS Code extension

The primary use case we have in mind for the sbt server is tooling integration such as editors and IDEs. As a proof of concept, we created a Visual Studio Code extension called [Scala (sbt)][vscode-sbt-scala].

Currently this extension is able to:

- Run `compile` at the root project when `*.scala` files are saved. [#3524][3524] by [@eed3si9n][@eed3si9n]
- Display compiler errors.
- Display log messages. [#3740][3740] by [@laughedelic][@laughedelic]
- Jump to class definitions. [#3660][3660] by [@wpopielarski][@wpopielarski]

#### Filtering scripted tests using `project/build.properties`

For all scripted tests in which `project/build.properties` exist, the value of the `sbt.version` property is read. If its binary version is different from `sbtBinaryVersion in pluginCrossBuild` the test will be skipped and a message indicating this will be logged.

This allows you to define scripted tests that track the minimum supported sbt versions, e.g. 0.13.9 and 1.0.0-RC2. [#3564][3564]/[#3566][3566] by [@jonas][@jonas]
