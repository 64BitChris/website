## sbt 0.13.5+ Technology Previews

sbt 0.13.5+ releases of sbt are technology previews of what's to come to sbt 1.0 with enhancements like [auto plugins][Auto-Plugins-Post], launcher enhacements for sbt server, defined in the sbt-remote-control project, and other necessary API changes.

These releases maintain binary compatibility with plugins that are published against sbt 0.13.0, but add new features in preparation for sbt 1.0. The tech previews allow us to test new ideas like auto plugins and performance improvements on dependency resolution; the build users can try new features without losing the existing plugin resources; and plugin authors can gradually migrate to the new plugin system before sbt 1.0 arrives.

## sbt 0.13.16

### Fixes with compatibility implications

- Removes the "hit \[ENTER\] to switch to interactive mode" feature. Run `sbt xxx shell` to stay in shell after `xxx`. [#3091][3091]/[#3153][3153] by [@dwijnand][@dwijnand]

### Improvements

- Improves the new startup messages. See below.
- Ports sbt-cross-building's `^` and `^^` commands for plugin cross building. See below.
- Adds `Zero` scope component for sbt 1.0 compatibility. [#3179][3179] by [@eed3si9n][@eed3si9n]
- Backports `withXXX` methods for `ModuleID` and `Artifact` for sbt 1.0 compatibility. [#3215][3215] by [@eed3si9n][@eed3si9n]

### Bug fixes

- Fixes the new startup messages. See below.
- Fixes forward compatibility of Scripted plugin with sbt 1.0.0-RC2. [#3329][3329] by [@dwijnand][@dwijnand]
- Fixes ScalaTest nested suite test names being reported as "(It is not a test)". [#3154][3154] by [@jameskoch][@jameskoch]
- Fixes default `scalaBinaryVersion` for Dotty. [#3152][3152] by [@smarter][@smater]
- Updates JLine dependency to 2.14.4 to work around ncurses change causing `NumberFormatException`. [#3265][3265] by [@Rogach][@Rogach]

### sbt-cross-building

[@jrudolph][@jrudolph]'s sbt-cross-building is a plugin author's plugin.
It adds cross command `^` and sbtVersion switch command `^^`, similar to `+` and `++`,
but for switching between multiple sbt versions across major versions.
sbt 0.13.16 merges these commands into sbt because the feature it provides is useful as we migrate plugins to sbt 1.0.

To switch the `sbtVersion in pluginCrossBuild` from the shell use:

```
^^ 1.0.0-RC2
```

Your plugin will now build with sbt 1.0.0-RC2 (and its Scala version 2.12.2).

If you need to make changes specific to a sbt version, you can now include them into `src/main/scala-sbt-0.13`,
and `src/main/scala-sbt-1.0`, where the binary sbt version number is used as postfix.

To run a command across multiple sbt versions, set:

```scala
crossSbtVersions := Vector("0.13.15", "1.0.0-RC2")
```

Then, run:

```
^ compile
```

[#3133][3133] by [@eed3si9n][@eed3si9n]

#### Eviction warning presentation

sbt 0.13.16 improves the eviction warning presetation.

Before:

    [warn] There may be incompatibilities among your library dependencies.
    [warn] Here are some of the libraries that were evicted:
    [warn]  * com.google.code.findbugs:jsr305:2.0.1 -> 3.0.0
    [warn] Run 'evicted' to see detailed eviction warnings

After:

    [warn] Found version conflict(s) in library dependencies; some are suspected to be binary incompatible:
    [warn]
    [warn]      * com.typesafe.akka:akka-actor_2.12:2.5.0 is selected over 2.4.17
    [warn]          +- de.heikoseeberger:akka-log4j_2.12:1.4.0            (depends on 2.5.0)
    [warn]          +- com.typesafe.akka:akka-parsing_2.12:10.0.6         (depends on 2.4.17)
    [warn]          +- com.typesafe.akka:akka-stream_2.12:2.4.17 ()       (depends on 2.4.17)
    [warn]
    [warn] Run 'evicted' to see detailed eviction warnings

[#3202][3202] by [@eed3si9n][@eed3si9n]

### Improvements and bug fixes to the startup messages

sbt writes out the `sbt.version` in `project/build.properties` if it is missing.
sbt 0.13.16 fixes the logging when it happens by using the logger.

We encourage the use of the sbt shell by running `sbt`, instead of running `sbt compile` from the terminal repreatedly.
The sbt shell keeps the JVM warm, and there is a significant performance improvement gained for your compilation.
The startup message that we added in sbt 0.13.15 was a bit too aggressive, so we are toning it down in 0.13.16.
It will only be triggered for `sbt compile`, and it can also be supressed with `suppressSbtShellNotification := true`.

## sbt 0.13.15

### Fixes with compatibility implications

- sbt 0.13.15 removes the Maven version range when possible. See below.

### Improvements

- Adds preliminary compatibility with JDK 9. Using this requires 0.13.15+ launcher. [#2951][2951]/[143][143] by [@retronym][@retronym]
- Adds "local-preloaded" repository for offline installation. See below.
- Notifies and enables users to stay in sbt's shell on the warm JVM by hitting `[ENTER]` while sbt is running. [#2987][2987]/[#2996][2996] by [@dwijnand][@dwijnand]
- Adds an `Append` instance to support `sourceGenerators += Def.task { ... }`, instead of needing `.taskValue`. [#2943][2943] by [@eed3si9n][@eed3si9n]
- Writes out the sbt.version in `project/build.properties` if it is missing. [#754][754]/[#3025][3025] by [@dwijnand][@dwijnand]
- XML generated by JUnitXmlTestsListener now correctly flags ignored, skipped and pending tests. [#2198][2198]/[#2854][2854] by [@ashleymercer][@ashleymercer]
- When sbt detects that the project is compiled with dotty, it now automatically
  sets `scalaCompilerBridgeSource` correctly, this reduces the boilerplate needed
  to make a dotty project. Note that dotty support in sbt is still considered
  experimental and not officially supported, see [dotty.epfl.ch][dotty] for
  more information. [#2902][2902] by [@smarter][@smarter]
- Updates sbt new's reference implementation to Giter8 0.7.2.
- ScriptedPlugin: Add the ability to paginate scripted tests.
  It is now possible to run a subset of scripted tests in a directory at once,
  for example:
  ```
  scripted source-dependencies/*1of3
  ```
  Will create three pages and run page 1. This is especially useful when running
  scripted tests on a CI, to benefit from the available parallelism. [3013][3013] by [@smarter][@smarter]

### Bug fixes

- Fixes .triggeredBy/.storeAs/etc not working when using `:=` and `.value` macros. [#1444][1444]/[#2908][2908] by [@dwijnand][@dwijnand]
- Fixes Ctrl-C not working on Windows by bumping up JLine. [#1855][1855] by [@eed3si9n][@eed3si9n]
- Fixes regressions in sbt 0.13.11 - 0.13.13 that processed build-level keys incorrectly. [#2851][2851]/[#2460][2460] by [@eed3si9n][@eed3si9n]
- Fixes a regression in sbt 0.13.12 that was misfiring Scala version enforcement when configuration does not extend `Compile`. [#2827][2827]/[#2786][2786] by [@eed3si9n][@eed3si9n]
- Fixes Scala binary version checking misfiring on configurations that do not extend `Compile`. [#2828][2828]/[#1466][1466] by [@eed3si9n][@eed3si9n]

- Fixes null sourceFile causing NPE. [#2766][2766] by [@avdv][@avdv]
- Fixes version parsing in validation. [#3011][3011] by [@eed3si9n][@eed3si9n]
- Fixes `Package.makeJar` deleting directory recursively. [#3014][3014] by [@larsrh][@larsrh]

### Maven version range improvement

Previously, when the dependency resolver (Ivy) encountered a Maven version range such as `[1.3.0,)`
it would go out to the Internet to find the latest version.
This would result to a surprising behavior where the eventual version keeps changing over time
*even when there's a version of the library that satisfies the range condition*.

Starting sbt 0.13.15, some Maven version ranges would be replaced with its lower bound
so that when a satisfactory version is found in the dependency graph it will be used.
You can disable this behavior using the JVM flag `-Dsbt.modversionrange=false`.

[#2954][2954] by [@eed3si9n][@eed3si9n]

### Offline installation

sbt 0.13.15 adds two new repositories called "local-preloaded-ivy"
and "local-preloaded" that point to `~/.sbt/preloaded/`.
The purpose for the repositories is to preload them with
sbt artifacts so the installation of sbt will not require access to the Internet.

This also improves the startup time of sbt when you first run it
since the resolution happens off of a local-preloaded repository.

[#2993][2993]/[#145][145] by [@eed3si9n][@eed3si9n]

### Notes

No changes should be necessary to your project definition and all plugins published for sbt 0.13.{x|x<14} should still work.

See [Migrating from sbt 0.12.x](http://www.scala-sbt.org/0.13/docs/Migrating-from-sbt-012x.html) for details on the old operator deprecation.

Special thanks to the contributors for making this release a success. According to `git shortlog -sn --no-merges v0.13.13..0.13.15`, compared to 0.13.13, there were 64 (non-merge) commits, by eleven contributors: Eugene Yokota, Dale Wijnand, Guillaume Martres, Jason Zaugg, Lars Hupel, Petro Verkhogliad, Eric Richardson, Claudio Bley, Haochi Chen, Paul Draper, Ashley Mercer.

## sbt 0.13.14

sbt 0.13.14 did not happen due a bug that was found after the artifact was published.

## sbt 0.13.13

### Fixes with compatibility implications

- Deprecates the old sbt 0.12 DSL, to be removed in sbt 1.0. See below for more details.
- The `.value` method is deprecated for input tasks. Calling `.value` on an input key returns an `InputTask[A]`,
  which is completely unintuitive and often results in a bug. In most cases `.evaluated` should be called,
  which returns `A` by evaluating the task.
  Just in case `InputTask[A]` is needed, `.inputTaskValue` method is now provided. [#2709][2709] by [@eed3si9n][@eed3si9n]
- sbt 0.13.13 renames the early command `--<command>` that was added in 0.13.1 to `early(<command>)`. This fixes the regression [#1041][1041]. For backward compatibility `--error`, `--warn`, `--info`, and `--debug` will continue to function during the 0.13 series, but it is strongly encouraged to migrate to the single hyphen options: `-error`, `-warn`, `-info`, and `-debug`. [#2742][2742] by [@eed3si9n][@eed3si9n]
- Improve `show` when key returns a `Seq` by showing the elements one per line. Disable with `-Dsbt.disable.show.seq=true`. [#2755][2755] by [@eed3si9n][@eed3si9n]
- Recycles classloaders to be anti-hostile to JIT. Disable with `-Dsbt.disable.interface.classloader.cache=true`. [#2754][2754] by [@retronym][@retronym]

### Improvements

- Adds `new` command and `templateResolverInfos`. See below for more details.
- Auto plugins can add synthetic subprojects. See below for more details.
- Supports wildcard exclusions in POMs [#1431][1431]/[sbt/ivy#22][sbt-ivy-22]/[#2731][2731] by [@jtgrabowski][@jtgrabowski]
- Adds the ability to call `aggregateProjects(..)` for the current project inside a build sbt file. [#2682][2682] by [@xuwei-k][@xuwei-k]
- Adds `.jvmopts` support to the launcher script. [sbt/sbt-launcher-package#111][111] by [@fommil][@fommil]
- Adds `.java-version` support to the Windows launcher script. [sbt/sbt-launcher-package#111][111] by [@fommil][@fommil]
- The startup log level is dropped to `-error` in script mode using `scalas`. [#840][840]/[#2746][2746] by [@eed3si9n][@eed3si9n]
- Adds `CrossVersion.patch` which sits in between `CrossVersion.binary` and `CrossVersion.full` in that it strips off any
  trailing `-bin-...` suffix which is used to distinguish variant but binary compatible Scala toolchain builds. Most things
  which are currently `CrossVersion.full` (eg. Scala compiler plugins, esp. macro-paradise) would be more appropriately
  depended on as `CrossVersion.patch` from this release on.

### Bug fixes

- Fixes a regression in sbt 0.13.12 that wrongly reports build-level keys to be ambiguous. [#2707][2707]/[#2708][2708] by [@Duhemm][@Duhemm]
- Fixes a regression in sbt 0.13.12 that was misfiring Scala version enforcement when an alternative `scalaOrganization` is set. [#2703][2703] by [@milessabin][@milessabin]
- Fixes `Tags.ForkedTestGroup`. [#2677][2677]/[#2681][2681] by [@pauldraper][@pauldraper]
- Fixes forked tests being reported as successful when the test harness fails. [#2442][2442]/[#2722][2722]/[#2730][2730] by [@eed3si9n][@eed3si9n]/[@dwijnand][@dwijnand]
- Fixes incorrect installation path on Windows. [sbt/sbt-launcher-package#110][110] by [@dwijnand][@dwijnand]

### new command and templateResolverInfos

sbt 0.13.13 adds a `new` command, which helps create new build definitions.
The `new` command is extensible via a mechanism called the template resolver.
A template resolver pattern matches on the passed in arguments after `new`,
and if it's a match it will apply the template.

As a reference implementation, template resolver for [Giter8][g8] is provided. For instance:

    sbt new eed3si9n/hello.g8

will run [eed3si9n/hello.g8][] using Giter8.

[#2705][2705] by [@eed3si9n][@eed3si9n]

### Synthetic subprojects

sbt 0.13.13 adds support for `AutoPlugin`s to define subprojects programmatically,
by overriding the `extraProjects` method:

    import sbt._, Keys._

    object ExtraProjectsPlugin extends AutoPlugin {
      override def extraProjects: Seq[Project] =
        List("foo", "bar", "baz") map generateProject

      def generateProject(id: String): Project =
        Project(id, file(id))
          .settings(
            name := id
          )
    }

In addition, subprojects may be derived from an existing subproject
by overriding `derivedProjects`:

    import sbt._, Keys._

    object DerivedProjectsPlugin extends AutoPlugin {
      // Enable this plugin by default
      override def requires: Plugins = sbt.plugins.CorePlugin
      override def trigger = allRequirements

      override def derivedProjects(proj: ProjectDefinition[_]): Seq[Project] =
        // Make sure to exclude project extras to avoid recursive generation
        if (proj.projectOrigin != ProjectOrigin.DerivedProject) {
          val id = proj.id + "1"
          Seq(
            Project(id, file(id))
              .enablePlugins(DatabasePlugin)
          )
        }
        else Nil
    }

[#2532][2532]/[#2717][2717]/[#2738][2738] by [@eed3si9n][@eed3si9n]

### Deprecate old sbt 0.12 DSL

The no-longer-documented operators `<<=`, `<+=`, and `<++=` and tuple enrichments are deprecated,
and will be removed in sbt 1.0.

Generally,

    task3 <<= (task1, task2) map { (t1, t2) => println(t1 + t2); t1 + t2 }

should migrate to

    task3 := {
      println(task1.value + task2.value)
      task1.value + task2.value
    }

Except for source generators, which requires task values:

    sourceGenerators in Compile <+= buildInfo

This becomes:

    sourceGenerators in Compile += buildInfo.taskValue

Another exception is input task:

    run <<= docsRunSetting

This becomes:

    run := docsRunSetting.evaluated

See [Migrating from sbt 0.12.x](http://www.scala-sbt.org/0.13/docs/Migrating-from-sbt-012x.html) for more details.

### Fixes with compatibility implications

- By default the Scala toolchain artifacts are now transitively resolved using the provided `scalaVersion` and
  `scalaOrganization`. Previously a user specified `scalaOrganization` would not have affected transitive
  dependencies on, eg. `scala-reflect`. An Ivy-level mechanism is used for this purpose, and as a consequence
  the overriding happens early in the resolution process which might improve resolution times, and as a side
  benefit fixes [#2286][2286]. The old behavior can be restored by adding
  `ivyScala := { ivyScala.value map {_.copy(overrideScalaVersion = sbtPlugin.value)} }`
  to your build. [#2286][2286]/[#2634][2634] by [@milessabin][milessabin]
- The Build trait is deprecated in favor of the `.sbt` format [#2530][2530] by [@dwijnand][@dwijnand]

### Improvements

- When `RecompileOnMacroDef` is enabled, sbt will now print out a info level log indicating that some sources are being recompiled because it's used from a source that contains a macro definition. Can be disabled with `incOptions := incOptions.value.withLogRecompileOnMacro(false)` [#2637][2637]/[#2659][2659] by [@eed3si9n][@eed3si9n]/[@dwijnand][@dwijnand]
- Adds Windows script support and native file extensions on Unix platforms. [#2603][2603] by [@ekrich][@ekrich]
- Improves loading time of large builds. [#2630][2630] by [@eed3si9n][@eed3si9n]
- Adds the ability to call `dependsOn` for the current project inside a `.sbt` file. [#2653][2653] by [@anatolydwnld][@anatolydwnld]

### Bug fixes

- Fixes a 0.13.11 regression: dependency resolution hitting Maven Central even with repository overrides. [#2519][2519]/[#2569][2569] by [@eed3si9n][@eed3si9n]
- Fixes a 0.13.11 regression in incremental compiler: `IndexOutOfBoundsException` in ExtractAPI [#2497][2497]/[#2557][2557] by [@smarter][@smarter]

- Fixes incremental compilation relying on filename of package objects. [#2438][2438] by [@Duhemm][@Duhemm]
- Provides a workaround flag `incOptions := incOptions.value.withIncludeSynthToNameHashing(true)` for name hashing not including synthetic methods. This will not be enabled by default in sbt 0.13. It can also enabled by passing `sbt.inc.include_synth=true` to JVM. [#2537][2537] by [@eed3si9n][@eed3si9n]
- Fixes tab completion for tasks defined in AutoPlugin's buildSettings [#2460][2460]/[#2469][2469] by [@Duhemm][@Duhemm]

### Fixes with compatibility implications

- JCenter is now opt-in. A new setting `useJCenter` can be set to `true` to re-include it, as the first external resolver to find library dependencies. [#2217][2217]/[#2467][2467] by [@eed3si9n][@eed3si9n]
- Adds `withInterProjectFirst` to the update option, which is enabled by default. When set to `true`, `inter-project` resolver will be prioritized above all resolvers and Ivy cache. [#1827][1827] by [@eed3si9n][@eed3si9n]

### Configurable Scala compiler bridge

sbt 0.13.11 adds `scalaCompilerBridgeSource` setting to specify the compiler brigde source. This allows different implementation of the bridge for Scala versions, and also allows future versions of Scala compiler implementation to diverge. The source module will be retrieved using library management configured by `bootIvyConfiguration` task.

[#2106][2106]/[#2197][2197]/[#2336][2336] by [@Duhemm][@Duhemm]

### Dotty awareness

sbt 0.13.11 will assume that Dotty is used when `scalaVersion` starts with `0.`.
The built-in compiler bridge in sbt does not support Dotty,
but a separate compiler bridge is being developed at [smarter/dotty-bridge](https://github.com/smarter/dotty-bridge) and
an example project that uses it is available at [smarter/dotty-example-project](https://github.com/smarter/dotty-example-project).

[#2344][2344] by [@smarter][@smarter]

### Inter-project dependency tracking

sbt 0.13.11 adds `trackInternalDependencies` and `exportToInternal` settings. These can be used to control whether to trigger compilation of a dependent subprojects when you call `compile`. Both keys will take one of three values: `TrackLevel.NoTracking`, `TrackLevel.TrackIfMissing`, and `TrackLevel.TrackAlways`. By default they are both set to `TrackLevel.TrackAlways`.

When `trackInternalDependencies` is set to `TrackLevel.TrackIfMissing`, sbt will no longer try to compile internal (inter-project) dependencies automatically, unless there are no `*.class` files (or JAR file when `exportJars` is `true`) in the output directory. When the setting is set to `TrackLevel.NoTracking`, the compilation of internal dependencies will be skipped. Note that the classpath will still be appended, and dependency graph will still show them as dependencies. The motivation is to save the I/O overhead of checking for the changes on a build with many subprojects during development. Here's how to set all subprojects to `TrackIfMissing`.

    lazy val root = (project in file(".")).
      aggregate(....).
      settings(
        inThisBuild(Seq(
          trackInternalDependencies := TrackLevel.TrackIfMissing,
          exportJars := true
        ))
      )

The `exportToInternal` setting allows the dependee subprojects to opt out of the internal tracking, which might be useful if you want to track most subprojects except for a few. The intersection of the `trackInternalDependencies` and `exportToInternal` settings will be used to determine the actual track level. Here's an example to opt-out one project:

    lazy val dontTrackMe = (project in file("dontTrackMe")).
      settings(
        exportToInternal := TrackLevel.NoTracking
      )

[#2266][2266]/[#2354][2354] by [@eed3si9n][@eed3si9n]

### Def.settings

Using `Def.settings` it is now possible to nicely define settings as such:

    val modelSettings = Def.settings(
      sharedSettings,
      libraryDependencies += foo
    )

### Fixes with compatibility implications

- Starting 0.13.9, `crossScalaVersions` default value is fixed back to the older 0.12.x behavior. See below for details.
- Starting 0.13.9, the generated POM files no longer include dependencies on source or javadoc jars obtained via `withSources()` or `withJavadoc()`. See below for details.
- Scala version is bumped to 2.10.5. This brings in the fix for [SI-9027][SI9027]: XML node sequence literal bug. [#1666][1666]/[#2068][2068] by [@eed3si9n][@eed3si9n]

### Improvements

- Adds `retrieveManaged` related improvements. See below for details.
- Adds `-=` and `--=` for settings and tasks, which are the opposites of `+=` and `++=`. [#1922][1922] by [@dwijnand][@dwijnand]
- Adds `inThisBuild`, similar to `inConfig`, to allow specifying multiple settings in `ThisBuild` scope. [#1847][1847]/[#1989][1989] by [@dwijnand][@dwijnand]
- Adds a nicer toString to SimpleCommand to make it more human-friendly. [#1998][1998]/[#2000][2000] by [@dwijnand][@dwijnand]
- Adds `forceUpdatePeriod` key, that takes values of `Option[FiniteDuration]`.  If set, a full `update` will occur after that amount of time without needing to explicitly run the `update` task. By [@ajsquared][@ajsquared]
- Updates `ForkError.getMessage()` to include exception's original name. [#2028][2028] by [@kamilkloch][@kamilkloch]

- Adds dependency-level exclusions in the POM for project-level exclusions. [#1877][1877]/[#2035][2035] by [@dwijnand][@dwijnand]

### `crossScalaVersions` default value

As of this fix `crossScalaVersions` returns to the behaviour present in `0.12.4` whereby it defaults to what
`scalaVersion` is set to, for example if `scalaVersion` is set to `"2.11.6"`, `crossScalaVersions` now defaults
to `Seq("2.11.6")`.

Therefore when upgrading from any version between `0.13.0` and `0.13.8` be aware of this new default if
your build setup depended on it.

[#1828][1828]/[#1992][1992] by [@dwijnand][@dwijnand]

### POM files no longer include certain source and javadoc jars

When declaring library dependencies using the withSources() or withJavadoc() options, sbt was also including
in the pom file, as dependencies, the source or javadoc jars using the default Maven scope. Such dependencies
might be erroneously processed as they were regular jars by automated tools

[#2001][2001]/[#2027][2027] by [@cunei][@cunei]

### `retrieveManaged` related improvements

sbt 0.13.9 adds `retrieveManagedSync` key that, when set to `true`, enables synchronizing retrieved to the current build by removed unneeded files.

It also adds `configurationsToRetrieve` key, that takes values of `Option[Set[Configuration]]`. If set, when `retrieveManaged` is true only artifacts in the specified configurations will be retrieved to the current build. 

[#1950][1950]/[#1987][1987] by [@ajsquared][@ajsquared]

### Cached resolution fixes

On a larger dependency graph, the JSON file growing to be 100MB+
with 97% of taken up by *caller* information.
To make the matter worse, these large JSON files were never cleaned up.

sbt 0.13.9 filters out artificial or duplicate callers,
which fixes `OutOfMemoryException` seen on some builds.
This generally shrinks the size of JSON, so it should make the IO operations faster.
Dynamic graphs will be rotated with directories named after `yyyy-mm-dd`,
and stale JSON files will be cleaned up after few days.

sbt 0.13.9 also fixes a correctness issue that was found in the earlier releases.
Under some circumstances, libraries that shouldn't have been evicted was being evicted.
This occured when library `A1` depended on `B2`, but a newer `A2` dropped the dependency,
and `A2` and `B1` are also is in the graph. This is fixed by sorting the graph prior to eviction.

[#2030][2030]/[#1721][1721]/[#2014][2014]/[#2046][2046]/[#2097][2097] by [@eed3si9n][@eed3si9n]

### Force GC

[@cunei][@cunei] in [#1223][1223] discovered that sbt leaks PermGen
when it creates classloaders to call Scala Compilers.
sbt 0.13.9 will call GC on a set interval (default: 60s).
It will also call GC right before cross building.
This behavior can diabled using by setting false to `forcegc`
setting or `sbt.task.forcegc` flag.

[#1773][1773] by [@eed3si9n][@eed3si9n]

### Maven compatibility fix

To resolve dynamic versions such as `SNAPSHOT` and version ranges, the dependency resolution engine
queries for the list of available versions.
For Maven repositories, it was supposed read `maven-metadata.xml` first, but
because sbt customizes the repository layout for cross building, it has been falling back
to screen scraping of the Apache directory listing.
This problem surfaced as:

- Version range not working for artifacts hosted on Bintray. [#2005][2005]
- Potentially other `SNAPSHOT` related issues.

sbt 0.13.9 fixes this by relaxing the Maven compatiblity check, so it will read `maven-metadata.xml`. [#2075][2075] by [@eed3si9n][@eed3si9n]

### Rolling back XML parsing workaround

sbt 0.13.7 implemented natural whitespace handling by switching `build.sbt` parsing to use Scala compiler, instead of blank line delimiting. We realized that some build definitions no longer parsed due to the difference in XML handling.

    val a = <x/><y/>
    val b = 0

At the time, we thought adding parentheses around XML nodes could work around this behavior. However, the workaround has caused [more issues][1738], and since then we have realized that this is a compiler issue [SI-9027][SI-9027], so we have decided to roll back our workaround. In the meantime, if you have consecutive XML elements in your build.sbt, enclose them in `<xml:group>` tag, or parentheses.

    val a = <xml:group><x/><y/></xml:group>
    val b = 0

[#1765][1765] by [@ajozwik][@ajozwik]

### Cross-version support for Scala sources

When `crossPaths` setting is set to `true` (it is `true` by default), sbt 0.13.8 will include
`src/main/scala-<scalaBinaryVersion>/` to the `Compile` compilation in addition to
`src/main/scala`. For example, it will include `src/main/scala-2.11/` for Scala 2.11.5, and
`src/main/scala-2.9.3` for Scala 2.9.3. [#1799][1799] by [@indrajitr][@indrajitr]

### Maven resolver plugin

sbt 0.13.8 adds an extension point in the dependency resolution to customize Maven resolvers.
This allows us to write sbt-maven-resolver auto plugin, which internally uses Eclipse Aether
to resolve Maven dependencies instead of Apache Ivy.

To enable this plugin, add the following to `project/maven.sbt` (or `project/plugin.sbt` the file name doesn't matter):

    addMavenResolverPlugin

This will create a new `~/.ivy2/maven-cache` directory, which contains the Aether cache of files.
You may notice some file will be re-downloaded for the new cache layout.
Additionally, sbt will now be able to fully construct
`maven-metadata.xml` files when publishing to remote repositories or when publishing to the local `~/.m2/repository`.
This should help erase many of the deficiencies encountered when using Maven and sbt together.

**Notes and known limitations**:

- sbt-maven-resolver requires sbt 0.13.8 and above.
- The current implementation does not support Ivy-style dynamic revisions, such as "2.10.+" or "latest.snapshot".  This
  is a fixable situation, but the version range query and Ivy -> Maven version range translation code has not been migrated.
- The current implementation does not support Maven-style range revisions if found on transitive dependencies. [#1921][1921]

[#1793][1793] by [@jsuereth][@jsuereth]

### Project-level dependency exclusions

sbt 0.13.8 adds **experimental** project-level dependency exclusions:

    excludeDependencies += "org.apache.logging.log4j"
    excludeDependencies += "com.example" %% "foo"

In the first example, all artifacts from the organization `"org.apache.logging.log4j"` are excluded from the managed dependency.
In the second example, artifacts with the organization `"com.example"` and the name `"foo"` cross versioned to the current `scalaVersion` are excluded.

**Note**: This feature currently does not translate to `pom.xml`!

[#1748][1748] by [@eed3si9n][@eed3si9n]

### Sequential tasks

sbt 0.13.8 adds a new `Def.sequential` function to run tasks under semi-sequential semantics.
Here's an example usage:

    lazy val root = project.
      settings(
        testFile := target.value / "test.txt",
        sideEffect0 := {
          val t = testFile.value
          IO.append(t, "0")
          t
        },
        sideEffect1 := {
          val t = testFile.value
          IO.append(t, "1")
          t
        },
        foo := Def.sequential(compile in Compile, sideEffect0, sideEffect1, test in Test).value
      )

Normally sbt's task engine will reorder tasks based on the dependencies among the tasks,
and run as many tasks in parallel (See [Custom settings and tasks][Custom-Settings0] for more details on this).
`Def.sequential` instead tries to run the tasks in the specified order.
However, the task engine will still deduplicate tasks. For instance, when `foo` is executed, it will only compile once,
even though `test in Test` depends on compile. [#1817][1817]/[#1001][1001] by [@eed3si9n][@eed3si9n]

### Nicer ways of declaring project settings

Now a `Seq[Setting[_]]` can be passed to `Project.settings` without the needs for "varargs expansion", ie. `: _*`

Instead of:

    lazy val foo = project settings (sharedSettings: _*)

It is now possible to do:

    lazy val foo = project settings sharedSettings

Also, `Seq[Setting[_]]` can be declared at the same level as individual settings in `Project.settings`, for instance:

    lazy val foo = project settings (
      sharedSettings,
      version := "1.0",
      someMoreSettings
    )

[#1902][1902] by [@dwijnand][@dwijnand]

### Bytecode Enhancers

sbt 0.13.8 adds an extension point whereby users can effectively manipulate java bytecode (.class files) *before* the
incremental compiler attempts to cache the classfile hashes.  This allows libraries like ebean to function with sbt
without corrupting the compiler cache and rerunning compile every few seconds.

This splits the compile task into several subTasks:

1. `previousCompile`:  This task returns the previously persisted `Analysis` object for this project.
2. `compileIncremental`: This is the core logic of compiling Scala/Java files together.   This task actually does the
    work of compiling a project incrementally, including ensuring a minimum number of source files are compiled.
    After this method, all .class files that would be generated by scalac + javac will be available.
3. `manipulateByteCode`: This is a stub task which takes the `compileIncremental` result and returns it.
    Plugins which need to manipulate bytecode are expected to override this task with their own implementation, ensuring
    to call the previous behavior.
4. `compile`:  This task depends on `manipulateBytecode` and then persists the `Analysis` object containing all
    incremental compiler information.

Here's an example of how to hook the new `manipulateBytecode` key in your own plugin:

    manipulateBytecode in Compile := {
      val previous = (manipulateBytecode in Compile).value
      doManipulateBytecode(previous)  // Note: This must return a new Compiler.CompileResult with our changes.
    }

See [#1714][1714] for the full details of the implementation.

### Fixes with compatibility implications

- Maven artifact dependencies will limit their transitive dependencies to `Compile` rather than *every configuration* if no `master` configuration is found. [#1586][1586] by [@jsuereth][@jsuereth]
- The new natural whitspace handling parser is unable to cope with certain classes of Scala syntax. In particular, top-level pattern matches, or multi-value defintions are no longer supported.

Here are examples:

```scala
val x, y = project // BAD
val x = project    // 
val y = project    //  GOOD

### Natural whitespace handling

Starting sbt 0.13.7, build.sbt will be parsed using a customized Scala parser. This eliminates the requirement to use blank line as the delimiter between each settings, and also allows blank lines to be inserted at arbitrary position within a block.

This feature can be disabled, if necessary, via the -Dsbt.parser.simple=true flag.

This feature was contributed by [Andrzej Jozwik (@ajozwik)](https://github.com/ajozwik), [Rafał Krzewski (@rkrzewski)][@rkrzewski] and others at [@WarsawScala][@WarsawScala] inspired by Typesafe's [@gkossakowski][@gkossakowski] organizing multiple [meetups](http://blog.japila.pl/2014/07/gkossakowski-on-warszawscala-about-how-to-patch-scalasbt/) and [hackathons](http://blog.japila.pl/2014/07/hacking-scalasbt-with-gkossakowski-on-warszawscala-meetup-in-javeo_eu/) on how to patch sbt with the focus on this blank line issue. Dziękujemy! [#1606][1606]

### Custom Maven local repository location

Maven local repository is now resolved from the first of:

- `<localRepository/>` element in `~/.m2/settings.xml`
- `<localRepository/>` element in `\$M2_HOME/conf/settings.xml`, or
- the default of `~/.m2/repository` if neither of those configuration elements exist

If more Maven settings are required to be recovered, the proper thing to do is merge the two possible `settings.xml` files, then query against the element path of the merge. This code avoids the merge by checking sequentially.

[#1589][1589]/[#1600][1600] by [@topping][@topping]

### Circular dependency

By default circular dependencies are warned, but they do not halt the dependency resolution. Using the following setting, circular dependencies can be treated as an error.

    updateOptions := updateOptions.value.withCircularDependencyLevel(CircularDependencyLevel.Error)

[#1601][1601] by [@eed3si9n][@eed3si9n]

### Cached resolution (minigraph caching)

sbt 0.13.7 adds a new **experimental** update option called *cached resolution*, which replaces consolidated resolution:

    updateOptions := updateOptions.value.withCachedResolution(true)

Unlike consolidated resolution, which only consolidated subprojects with identical dependency graph, cached resolution create an artificial graph for each direct dependency (minigraph) for all subprojects, resolves them independently, saves them into json file, and stiches the minigraphs together.

Once the minigraphs are resolved and saved as files, dependency resolution turns into a matter of loading json file from the second run onwards, which should complete in a matter of seconds even for large projects. Also, because the files are saved under a global `~/.sbt/0.13/dependency` (or what's specified by `sbt.dependency.base` flag), the resolution result is shared across all builds.

Breaking graphs into minigraphs allows partial resolution results to be shared, which scales better for subprojects with similar but slightly different dependencies, and also for making small changes to the dependencies graph over time. See [documentation on cached resolution][Cached-Resolution] for more details.

### HTTPS related changes

Thanks to Sonatype, HTTPS access to Maven Central Repository is available to public. This is now enabled by default, but if HTTP is required for some reason the following system properties can be used:

    -Dsbt.repository.secure=false

Java.net Maven 2 repository, Typesafe repository, and sbt Plugin repository also defaults to HTTPS.

[#1494][1494] by [@rtyley][@rtyley], [#1536][1536] by [@benmccann][@benmccann], and [#1541][1541] by [@eed3si9n][@eed3si9n].

### enablePlugins/disablePlugins

sbt 0.13.6 now allows `enablePlugins` and `disablePlugins` to be written directly in `build.sbt`. [#1213][1213]/[#1312][1312] by [@jsuereth][@jsuereth]

### Unresolved dependencies error

sbt 0.13.6 will try to reconstruct dependencies tree when it fails to resolve a managed dependency.
This is an approximation, but it should help you figure out where the problematic dependency is coming from. When possible sbt will display the source position next to the modules:

    [warn]  ::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
    [warn]  ::          UNRESOLVED DEPENDENCIES         ::
    [warn]  ::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
    [warn]  :: foundrylogic.vpp#vpp;2.2.1: not found
    [warn]  ::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
    [warn] 
    [warn]  Note: Unresolved dependencies path:
    [warn]      foundrylogic.vpp:vpp:2.2.1
    [warn]        +- org.apache.cayenne:cayenne-tools:3.0.2
    [warn]        +- org.apache.cayenne.plugins:maven-cayenne-plugin:3.0.2 (/foo/some-test/build.sbt#L28)
    [warn]        +- d:d_2.10:0.1-SNAPSHOT

[#528][528]/[#1422][1422]/[#1447][1447] by [@eed3si9n][@eed3si9n]

### Eviction warnings

sbt 0.13.6 displays eviction warnings when it resolves your project's managed dependencies via `update` task.
Currently the eviction warnings are categorized into three layers: `scalaVersion` eviction, direct evictions, and transitive evictions.
By default eviction warning on `update` task will display only `scalaVersion` evictin and direct evictions.

`scalaVersion` eviction warns you when `scalaVersion` is no longer effecitive. This happens when one of your dependency depends on a newer release of scala-library than your `scalaVersion`.
Direct evctions are evictions related to your direct dependencies. Warnings are displayed only when API incompatibility is suspected. For Java libraries, Semantic Versioning is used for guessing, and for Scala libraries Second Segment versioning (second segment bump makes API incompatible) is used.

To display all eviction warnings with caller information, run `evicted` task.

    [warn] There may be incompatibilities among your library dependencies.
    [warn] Here are some of the libraries that were evicted:
    [warn]     * com.typesafe.akka:akka-actor_2.10:2.1.4 -> 2.3.4 (caller: com.typesafe.akka:akka-remote_2.10:2.3.4,
    org.w3:banana-sesame_2.10:0.4, org.w3:banana-rdf_2.10:0.4)

[#1200][1200]/[#1467][1467] by [@eed3si9n][@eed3si9n]

### Latest SNAPSHOTs

sbt 0.13.6 adds a new setting key called `updateOptions` for customizing the details of managed dependency resolution with `update` task. One of its flags is called `lastestSnapshots`, which controls the behavior of the chained resolver. Up until 0.13.6, sbt was picking the first `-SNAPSHOT` revision it found along the chain. When `latestSnapshots` is enabled (default: `true`), it will look into all resolvers on the chain, and compare them using the publish date.

The tradeoff is probably a longer resolution time if you have many remote repositories on the build or you live away from the severs. So here's how to disable it:

    updateOptions := updateOptions.value.withLatestSnapshots(false)

[#1514][1514] by [@eed3si9n][@eed3si9n]

### Consolidated resolution

`updateOptions` can also be used to enable consolidated resolution for `update` task.

    updateOptions := updateOptions.value.withConsolidatedResolution(true)

This feature is specifically targeted to address [Ivy resolution is beging slow for multi-module projects #413][413]. Consolidated resolution aims to fix this issue by artificially constructing an Ivy dependency graph for the unique managed dependencies. If two subprojects introduce identical external dependencies, both subprojects should consolidate to the same graph, and therefore resolve immediately for the second `update`. [#1454][1454] by [@eed3si9n][@eed3si9n]

## sbt 0.13.5

  [Auto-Plugins-Post]: https://typesafe.com/blog/preview-of-upcoming-sbt-10-features-read-about-the-new-plugins

sbt 0.13.5 is a technology preview of what's to come to sbt 1.0 with enhancements like [auto plugins][Auto-Plugins-Post] and the necessary APIs changes and launcher for "sbt as a server.", defined in the sbt-remote-control project.

- The Scala version for sbt and sbt plugins is now 2.10.4. This is a compatible version bump.
- Added a new setting testResultLogger to allow customisation of logging of test results. (#1225)
- When test is run and there are no tests available, omit logging output. Especially useful for aggregate modules. test-only et al unaffected. (#1185)
- sbt now uses minor-patch version of ivy 2.3 (org.scala-sbt.ivy:ivy:2.3.0-sbt-<git sha>)
- `sbt.Plugin` deprecated in favor of `sbt.AutoPlugin`
- name-hashing incremental compiler now supports scala macros.
- `testResultLogger` is now configured.
- sbt-server hooks for task cancellation.
- Add `JUnitXmlReportPlugin` which generates junit-xml-reports for all tests.
- Optionally enable forced garbage collection after tasks (`-Dsbt.task.forcegc=true`).
