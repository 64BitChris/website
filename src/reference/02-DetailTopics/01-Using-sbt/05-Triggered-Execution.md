Triggered Execution
-------------------

You can make a command run when certain files change by prefixing the
command with `~`. Monitoring is terminated when `enter` is pressed. This
triggered execution is configured by the `watch` setting, but typically
the basic settings `watchSources` and `pollInterval` are modified.

-   `watchSources` defines the files for a single project that are
    monitored for changes. By default, a project watches resources and
    Scala and Java sources.
-   `watchTransitiveSources` then combines the `watchSources` for the
    current project and all execution and classpath dependencies (see
    [.scala build definition][Full-Def] for details on
    interProject dependencies).
-   `pollInterval` selects the interval between polling for changes in
    milliseconds. The default value is 500 ms.

Some example usages are described below.

### Compile

The original use-case was continuous compilation:

```
> ~ test:compile

> ~ compile
```

### Testing

You can use the triggered execution feature to run any command or task.
One use is for test driven development, as suggested by Erick on the
mailing list.

The following will poll for changes to your source code (main or test)
and run `testOnly` for the specified test.

```
> ~ testOnly example.TestA
```

### Running Multiple Commands

Occasionally, you may need to trigger the execution of multiple
commands. You can use semicolons to separate the commands to be
triggered.

The following will poll for source changes and run `clean` and `test`.

```
> ~ clean; test
```
