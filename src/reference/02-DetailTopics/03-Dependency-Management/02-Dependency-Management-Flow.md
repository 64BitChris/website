Dependency Management Flow
--------------------------

sbt 0.12.1 addresses several issues with dependency management. These fixes
were made possible by specific, reproducible examples, such as a
situation where the resolution cache got out of date (gh-532). A brief
summary of the current work flow with dependency management in sbt
follows.

### Background

`update` resolves dependencies according to the settings in a build
file, such as `libraryDependencies` and `resolvers`. Other tasks use the
output of `update` (an `UpdateReport`) to form various classpaths. Tasks
that in turn use these classpaths, such as `compile` or `run`, thus
indirectly depend on `update`. This means that before `compile` can run,
the `update` task needs to run. However, resolving dependencies on every
`compile` would be unnecessarily slow and so `update` must be particular
about when it actually performs a resolution.

### Caching and Configuration

1.  Normally, if no dependency management configuration has changed
    since the last successful resolution and the retrieved files are
    still present, sbt does not ask Ivy to perform resolution.
2.  Changing the configuration, such as adding or removing dependencies
    or changing the version or other attributes of a dependency, will
    automatically cause resolution to be performed. Updates to locally
    published dependencies should be detected in sbt 0.12.1 and later
    and will force an update. Dependent tasks like compile and run will
    get updated classpaths.
3.  Directly running the `update` task (as opposed to a task that
    depends on it) will force resolution to run, whether or not
    configuration changed. This should be done in order to refresh
    remote SNAPSHOT dependencies.
4.  When `offline := true`, remote SNAPSHOTs will not be updated by a
    resolution, even an explicitly requested update. This should
    effectively support working without a connection to remote
    repositories. Reproducible examples demonstrating otherwise are
    appreciated. Obviously, update must have successfully run before
    going offline.
5.  Overriding all of the above, `skip in update := true` will tell sbt
    to never perform resolution. Note that this can cause dependent
    tasks to fail. For example, compilation may fail if jars have been
    deleted from the cache (and so needed classes are missing) or a
    dependency has been added (but will not be resolved because skip is
    true). Also, update itself will immediately fail if resolution has
    not been allowed to run since the last clean.

### General troubleshooting steps

1.  Run `update` explicitly. This will typically fix problems with out
    of date SNAPSHOTs or locally published artifacts.
2.  If a file cannot be found, look at the output of update to see where
    Ivy is looking for the file. This may help diagnose an incorrectly
    defined dependency or a dependency that is actually not present in a
    repository.
3.  `last update` contains more information about the most recent
    resolution and download. The amount of debugging output from Ivy is
    high, so you may want to use last-grep (run help last-grep for usage).
4.  Run `clean` and then `update`. If this works, it could indicate a
    bug in sbt, but the problem would need to be reproduced in order to
    diagnose and fix it.
5.  Before deleting all of the Ivy cache, first try deleting files in
    `~/.ivy2/cache` related to problematic dependencies. For example, if
    there are problems with dependency `"org.example" % "demo" % "1.0"`,
    delete `~/.ivy2/cache/org.example/demo/1.0/` and retry update. This
    avoids needing to redownload all dependencies.
6.  Normal sbt usage should not require deleting files from
    `~/.ivy2/cache`, especially if the first four steps have been
    followed. If deleting the cache fixes a dependency management issue,
    please try to reproduce the issue and submit a test case.

### Plugins

These troubleshooting steps can be run for plugins by changing to the
build definition project, running the commands, and then returning to
the main project. For example:

```
> reload plugins
> update
> reload return
```

### Notes

1.  Configure offline behavior for all projects on a machine by putting
    `offline := true` in `$global_sbt_file$`. A command that does this for
    the user would make a nice pull request. Perhaps the setting of
    offline should go into the output of about or should it be a warning
    in the output of update or both?
2.  The cache improvements in 0.12.1 address issues in the change
    detection for update so that it will correctly re-resolve
    automatically in more situations. A problem with an out of date
    cache can usually be attributed to a bug in that change detection if
    explicitly running update fixes the problem.
3.  A common solution to dependency management problems in sbt has been
    to remove `~/.ivy2/cache`. Before doing this with 0.12.1, be sure to
    follow the steps in the troubleshooting section first. In
    particular, verify that a clean and an explicit update do not solve
    the issue.
4.  There is no need to mark SNAPSHOT dependencies as `changing()`
    because sbt configures Ivy to know this already.
